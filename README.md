# WildFireTracker 
(Alerts Service isn't implemented yet!!!)
WildFireTracker is an Android app, which uses the EONET API by NASA to track
wildfires all over the world. The wildfires are displayed with the help of Google maps.
Also, you can save your favorite locations and check if there is a live wildfire within a
radius of 500 kilometers.
